      "content": "Email header / footerAdd bylineI need to confess something uncomfortable: I’m a tab hoarder. Not the cute kind with three neatly organized tabs. I’m talking 70+ tabs—collapsed into groups with hopeful names like “Pixazo” and “HF_news” so I can pretend I’m “organized,” but really just hiding the chaos.News articles from Tuesday. GitHub repos I’ll “explore later.” That Medium post about ByteShape models bookmarked next to llama.cpp documentation. Three different tabs for the same recipe because Chrome froze mid-scroll and I just… opened a new one.Sound familiar?I believed the lie that saving tabs equals processing them. Browser extensions promised me to “group” or “archive” my tabs—but that’s just moving digital clutter to a different shelf. The real problem of course is not the tabs themselves. It’s that we can mistake activity for progress. Opening a tab feels productive. But unless we actually digest what we’ve seen? It’s just noise.a RAM CPU and DISK usage dashboard. Modern and glossy style, glowing redThe Breaking Point: 2.5GB of RAM and Zero ClarityLast Tuesday, Chrome was using 2.5GB of RAM just for my browsing session. My laptop fan sounded like a jet engine. I had six tab groups collapsed—each one a monument to good intentions I’d abandoned.And the brutal truth… I finally admitted while waiting 45 seconds for a tab to load: None of those tabs represented actual learning. Just digital anxiety.I’d spent an hour that morning opening tabs about local AI tools—but could I tell you one concrete thing I’d learned? Nope. Just the vague feeling of “I should read more of these.”That’s when I snapped. I Googled: ”chrome extension that track daily browser visits time reading and can extract website content” (yes, I literally searched that exact phrase—you can see it in my JSON export).And that’s how I fell down a rabbit hole that actually led somewhere.A GitHub Rabbit Hole that actually paid offI found a tiny GitHub repo called “Browsing Digest”—a Python script that promised to generate a daily summary of your browsing using a local AI model. No cloud uploads. No tracking. Just a clean 2-minute digest of what you explored.The app is quite simple, and run in the Terminal window:you install a chrome extension that keeps track of your browsing tabs, time spent on those tabs, and content.at one point you export the daily logs from the extension into a json file, into the directory of the repository cloned on your PCyou fire up your local AI engine (the original app wants ollama, but I really don’y like it), in my case llama.cpp serveryou run the python script with the exported json as an argument.You get a brand new markdown file with the daily digest of your web browsing activityI cloned the Repository immediately. The repo said it was easy... but on my Windows laptop I got a total meltdown with this error:UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u200e'...Translation for non-coders:”Windows choked on a special character (like a left-to-right mark from an Arabic news site) when trying to send my browsing history to the AI.”I almost gave up. Another “Linux-only” tool that assumes everyone codes on a MacBook. But then I had a thought that changed everything: What if I used AI to fix this AI tool?How I built a smart downloader with Python + AI1 febRead full storyWhy JSON keys with spaces broke my brain (and how we fixed it)First surprise: my browser extension exported malformed JSON. Keys had trailing spaces like \"date \" instead of \"date\". Python couldn’t find the data it needed.Here’s what the raw JSON looked like (I’ve seen this in my own exports!):{ \"date \": \"2026-02-06 \", // ← See the space after \"date\"? \"pages \": [ ... ] // ← And here? }Instead of manually fixing dozens of files, I asked my AI assistant:”How can I automatically repair JSON files where keys have accidental spaces?”It gave me this elegant recursive function:def normalize_json_keys(obj): \"\"\"Fix keys like \"date \" → \"date\" automatically\"\"\" if isinstance(obj, dict): return { key.strip(): normalize_json_keys(value) # ← strip whitespace from keys for key, value in obj.items() } elif isinstance(obj, list): return [normalize_json_keys(item) for item in obj] elif isinstance(obj, str): return obj.strip() # ← also clean string values else: return objWhy this matters for beginners:You don’t need to understand recursion deeply to use this. Just know: ”This function walks through my entire JSON file and quietly fixes messy keys/values.” It’s a digital cleaner that works while you sleep.When the script runs, it:Detects malformed keys automaticallyCreates a .json.bak backup (so you never lose data)Repairs the file silentlyContinues processingNo more manual cleanup. No more “why won’t this work?!” frustration.How the script loads and prepares your browsing dataOnce the JSON is repaired, the script does two important things:1. Loads your browsing historyThe load_browsing_data() function reads your JSON export and validates it has the required stru... [truncated]",

The idea is being able to explore destination opportunities through non-stop flights from a specific airport. It's a tool to set up your business meeting or weekend holiday based on your time schedule and your closest airport. Looking for flights with stops? Check out Flightroutes.com, an evolution of FlightsFrom with connecting flights. Part of its appeal is that it just makes trips easier to plan; you see the departure times of every non-stop flight in a list. I always wondered where you could fly direct from a particular airport (Burbank, I’m looking at you) and those answers can be tough to find. Not anymore! Many mainstream sites don’t list low-cost carriers or link transoceanic flights to regionally based carriers that can provide less expensive options. For that, you need a bigger tool kit… (Hint: search by destination airport at FlightsFrom.com) Many low-cost carriers airlines prevent their flights from showing up on some of these (read Vayama or Google Flights) third-party travel websites.

Both drives readily appeared in the \"Network\" folder and clicking on them provided folder access which could be directly mapped as network drives and then could be accessed on multiple computers connected to my network. Since then (I suspect as a consequence of various Windows updates) one of the drives (WDMyCloud) is only be visible by its web page and cannot now be mapped as a drive and the other cannot be found at all! I have made no changes to the configuration of either drive at any point. The original shares are still mapped and working and I have noticed that ONLY on one (Windows 11) laptop there is an option to right-click on the WD drive web link in \"Network\" and map it with \"Mount Public Share\". This option is missing on my recently upgraded Windows 11 laptop and two other Windows 10 laptops. The other Raspberry Pi shared drive now does not show up at all in my network on any of my computers, but is still accessible on the previously set up mapped shares in the file explorer, so the drive is still working and accessible - it is just not visible in the network folder any more. This is a problem because I'm about to upgrade my existing Windows 10 computers, but my experience with my first upgrade is that, once I have lost the working mapping to the drives, I can't seem to get them back again in Windows 11! It seems that Windows is now blocking access because I have no problem in getting read-write capability via Android on my phone and tablet. I have also noticed that the File Explorer window for the \"Network\" folder in my Windows 10 laptop has a drop-down option for past selections where I can select the Rasperry Pi drive (presumably accessed in the past) as a folder. This is not available in Windows 11. I am assuming that Windows 10 updates and Windows 11 has deactivated the ability to see and gain access network drives, but how do I repair this? I need to get to the bottom of this before I move further to Windows 11 otherwise I'll have no means of using my drives except by using Android!

We understand how important it is to keep your network drives accessible, especially during system upgrades. Recent Windows 10 updates and Windows 11 security changes have introduced stricter network and SMB (Server Message Block) settings, which can cause devices like WD MyCloud and Raspberry Pi Samba shares to disappear from the Network view, even though existing mapped drives still work. The good news is that your drives are still functional, and you can restore full access by following these steps: 1 - Enable Network Discovery Go to Settings → Network & Internet → Advanced sharing settings. Turn on Network Discovery and File and Printer Sharing. In Services (services.msc), set these to Automatic (Delayed Start) and Running: Function Discovery Provider Host Function Discovery Resource Publication SSDP Discovery UPnP Device Host 2 - Map Drives by IP Address In File Explorer, go to This PC → Map Network Drive. Enter: \\\\[Device IP]\\[Share Name] (Example: \\192.168.1.50\\Public) 3 - Adjust SMB Settings Open Windows Features (optionalfeatures.exe) and enable: SMB 1.0/CIFS Client (only if your device requires it). For WD MyCloud, ensure it supports SMB2 or SMB3. If needed, disable mandatory SMB signing (safe on trusted home networks). 4 - Update Raspberry Pi Samba Config If your Raspberry Pi is running Samba for file sharing, older configurations may still default to SMB1, which Windows 10/11 no longer supports. To ensure compatibility: Ensure your smb.conf includes: server min protocol = SMB2 client min protocol = SMB2 Restart Samba service on the Pi: sudo systemctl restart smbd I look forward to receiving your update and I'm willing to collaborate with you till we resolve the issue.

Main issue we have a share folder on a Windows 10 machine. Out of the blue we get the fun organization’s security policies message. So it can't connect. Was fine last week, this week it's a no go. I've tried the regedit with changing AllowsecureGuestAuth to 1. Still won't connect. My issues is it's still doing it. Anyone have a fix that works? Read other post with the same ISSUE, but they're over 10 pages long and gave up. I also looked at the useless defender and enable printer sharing with all those setting to yes. Still no connect the the desired network.

We're sitting at home or at work reading your comments, but we didn't set up your environment. We don't know anything about your pc's, your accounts, your network, nothing. So when you comment \"Out of the blue we get the fun organization’s security policies message\", we have no idea what that message says. We have no idea what circumstance would cause that message to be displayed. When you say \"Was fine last week, this week it's a no go\", well, what did you change? We don't know what you or anyone else in your organization has done. Who manages your network? Have you asked them for help? What do they say? Are you using Active Directory or local accounts? I do not recommend using the guest account. If you are using local accounts, then I think that it's better to define accounts with the same name and password on each PC so that you can cross authenticate. Credential manager is another alternative. Based on \"Still won't connect.\", please describe what account you are using. Is there an equivalent account on the target machine? What error do you see in the security eventlog on the target machine? We're happy to help you, but we really need specific details about what you are doing. Please sign in to rate this answer.

      "content": "Your Tabs are lying to youHow I tamed my 70-tab chaos with a 100-line Python script, and finally stopped pretending I’d “read those later”Type caption for image (optional)I need to confess something uncomfortable: I’m a tab hoarder.Not the cute kind with three neatly organized tabs. I’m talking 70+ tabs — collapsed into groups with hopeful names like “Pixazo” and “HF_news” so I can pretend I’m “organized,” but really just hiding the chaos.News articles from Tuesday. GitHub repos I’ll “explore later.” That Medium post about ByteShape models bookmarked next to llama.cpp documentation. Three different tabs for the same recipe because Chrome froze mid-scroll and I just… opened a new one.Sound familiar?I believed the lie that saving tabs equals processing them. Browser extensions promised me to “group” or “archive” my tabs — but that’s just moving digital clutter to a different shelf. The real problem of course is not the tabs themselves. It’s that we can mistake activity for progress.Opening a tab feels productive. But unless we actually digest what we’ve seen? It’s just noise.a RAM CPU and DISK usage dashboard. Modern and glossy style, glowing redThe Breaking Point: 2.5GB of RAM and Zero ClarityLast Tuesday, Chrome was using 2.5GB of RAM just for my browsing session. My laptop fan sounded like a jet engine. I had six tab groups collapsed — each one a monument to good intentions I’d abandoned.And the brutal truth… I finally admitted while waiting 45 seconds for a tab to load: None of those tabs represented actual learning. Just digital anxiety.I’d spent an hour that morning opening tabs about local AI tools — but could I tell you one concrete thing I’d learned? Nope. Just the vague feeling of “I should read more of these.”That’s when I snapped. I Googled: ”chrome extension that track daily browser visits time reading and can extract website content” (yes, I literally searched that exact phrase — you can see it in my JSON export).And that’s how I fell down a rabbit hole that actually led somewhere.A GitHub Rabbit Hole that actually paid offI found a tiny GitHub repo called “Browsing Digest” — a Python script that promised to generate a daily summary of your browsing using a local AI model. No cloud uploads. No tracking. Just a clean 2-minute digest of what you explored.The app is quite simple, and run in the Terminal window:you install a chrome extension that keeps track of your browsing tabs, time spent on those tabs, and content.at one point you export the daily logs from the extension into a json file, into the directory of the repository cloned on your PCType caption for image (optional)you fire up your local AI engine (the original app wants ollama, but I really don’y like it), in my case llama.cpp serveryou run the python script with the exported json as an argument.You get a brand new markdown file with the daily digest of your web browsing activityI cloned the Repository immediately. The repo said it was easy… but on my Windows laptop I got a total meltdown with this error:UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u200e'...Auto (Rust)Translation for non-coders:”Windows choked on a special character (like a left-to-right mark from an Arabic news site) when trying to send my browsing history to the AI.”I almost gave up. Another “Linux-only” tool that assumes everyone codes on a MacBook. But then I had a thought that changed everything: What if I used AI to fix this AI tool?The secret Google LLM nobody is talking about.T5Gemma series of encoder-decoder models: the smart upgrade of the T5 familygenerativeai.pubWhy JSON keys with spaces broke my brain (and how we fixed it)First surprise: my browser extension exported malformed JSON. Keys had trailing spaces like \"date \" instead of \"date\". Python couldn’t find the data it needed.Here’s what the raw JSON looked like (I’ve seen this in my own exports!):{ \"date \": \"2026-02-06 \", // ← See the space after \"date\"? \"pages \": [ ... ] // ← And here?}Auto (C++)Instead of manually fixing dozens of files, I asked my AI assistant:”How can I automatically repair JSON files where keys have accidental spaces?”It gave me this elegant recursive function:def normalize_json_keys(obj): \"\"\"Fix keys like \"date \" → \"date\" automatically\"\"\" if isinstance(obj, dict): return { key.strip(): normalize_json_keys(value) # ← strip whitespace from keys for key, value in obj.items() } elif isinstance(obj, list): return [normalize_json_keys(item) for item in obj] elif isinstance(obj, str): return obj.strip() # ← also clean string values else: return objAuto (Python)Why this matters for beginners:You don’t need to understand recursion deeply to use this. Just know: ”This function walks through my entire JSON file and quietly fixes messy keys/values.” It’s a digital cleaner that works while you sleep.When the script runs, it:Detects malformed keys automaticallyCreates a .json.bak backup (so you never lose data)Repairs the file silentlyContinues processingNo more manual cleanup. ...

In this article you will find a collection of the best CSS Buttons. Updated version is available (click)! 🔥 Whether big and bold on your home page or small and discreet in the footer, buttons are a very important design element for the user flow on your website. For a corporate website, a more discreet design is often used, while creative industries tend to use more eye-catching and “flashy” buttons. So that all industries are equally served, you will find many different button styles here. I – and many other web developers/designers – also set a high value on animations for Hover or Focus, which is why all of the following buttons bring along nice animations. But now we start directly!

Me too.Turns out, to be a good writer… you’ve got to be a good reader!And if you’ve ever caught yourself thinking, “There’s got to be a better way,” — congrats. You’re not lazy. You’re just one script away from freedom.Welcome to From Zero to AI Automation: A Python Adventure — a nine-part journey about how I built my own AI sidekick using nothing but Python, free tools, and sheer stubbornness to stop wasting time on soul-crushing repetition.Spoiler: It now reads the news for me. While I sleep. And emails me a crisp summary like a tiny, slightly overeager assistant… and he never asks for coffee.I’m a Process Automation Software Engineer — so yes, I specialize in orchestrating motors, pumps, and valves… and no, we don’t usually use Python.If you still don’t believe me… here’s the project I’ve been building:Press enter or click to view image in full sizeNGUYA FLNG Sail Away ceremonyBut let’s get back to Python and AI…Press enter or click to view image in full sizeimage by the author and Flux with this methodWhy I started this madnessIt all began with a simple question:“Why am I doing work a robot could do?”I was researching AI trends (the irony!) and found myself repeating the same steps every day:Search for the 6 latest articles about “AI in healthcare” (or whatever my topic was that week).Open each link.Skim (okay, sometimes just pretend to read).Try to remember the key points.Summarize them.Make a table of contents for my notes.Extract keywords (because SEO, apparently, still matters).Email it to myself. (Yes, I have an ongoing conversation with Future Me. It’s not weird.) I always use the same email Subject starting with “IDEA” and Gmail automatically apply a label for mePress enter or click to view image in full sizemy tagging strategy…After the third day, I snapped.I said aloud to my dog Pepe:“If AI is so smart, why am I the one doing all the work?”He stared at me. Then walked away. Clearly, he had better things to do.So I decided: No more.I would build a system that did the boring part. I’d keep the fun part — thinking, deciding, creating.And thus, The Automation Chronicles was born.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeimage by the author and Flux with this methodWhat Is This Series?Each post is a standalone mission in our battle against monotony. Think of it like a superhero origin story — but instead of radioactive spiders, I used requests, DuckDuckGo, and a local LLM named LFM2, or Gemma3.All free resource and projects, not to pay a penny!Here’s what we’ll build, one post at a time:🕵️‍♂️ Mission 1: How I taught Python to search the web and fetch fresh articles — without getting blocked (or mistaken for a hacker).🧠 Mission 2: How AI reads those articles and summarizes them in plain English — no jargon, no fluff.📋 Mission 3: Auto-generating a clean table of contents — because even robots need structure.🔑 Mission 4: Extracting keywords like a digital bloodhound — to spot trends before they trend.📬 Mission 5: Sending a daily recap to my inbox — like a newsletter, but just for me.🔗 Missions 6 & 7: Integration→ “Mission 6: The Grand Assembly — Connecting All Your AI Tools→ “Mission 7: Make your script unbreakable. Error Handling, Scheduling & Logs🤖 Mission 8: GUI. One Click to Rule Them All — Build a GUI for Your AI ButlerAs motivation… here the final resultPress enter or click to view image in full size🚀 Mission 9: What’s next? Scheduling, voice commands, or maybe even a robot butler? (Okay, maybe not the butler. But we’ll see.)Each post is beginner-friendly. No rocket science degree required.Just curiosity, a bit of Python (or willingness to learn), and the desire to never manually summarize an article again.But Wait — Isn’t AI scary? Who’s in Control?Great question.I’m not building Skynet.I’m building a tool — one that helps me work smarter, not one that replaces me.And here’s the best part: you don’t need cloud-based AI, paid APIs, or Big Tech watching your every move.All of this can run on your own computer, using open-source tools like llama.cpp and powerful local models like Gemma3 (now in super small format of 270M parameters), Qwen3, or LFM2–1.2b.That means:No sending your data to some server in the cloud.No surprise bills.Full control. Full privacy.You’re always in charge.I want an AI with training wheels — smart enough to help, but still needing you to steer.I don’t like anything replacing humans.I want what is supercharging us.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeimage by the author and Flux with this m...

GitHub repos I’ll “explore later.” That Medium post about ByteShape models bookmarked next to llama.cpp documentation. Three different tabs for the same recipe because Chrome froze mid-scroll and I just… opened a new one.Sound familiar?I believed the lie that saving tabs equals processing them. Browser extensions promised me to “group” or “archive” my tabs — but that’s just moving digital clutter to a different shelf. The real problem of course is not the tabs themselves. It’s that we can mistake activity for progress.Opening a tab feels productive. But unless we actually digest what we’ve seen? It’s just noise.a RAM CPU and DISK usage dashboard. Modern and glossy style, glowing redThe Breaking Point: 2.5GB of RAM and Zero ClarityLast Tuesday, Chrome was using 2.5GB of RAM just for my browsing session. My laptop fan sounded like a jet engine. I had six tab groups collapsed — each one a monument to good intentions I’d abandoned.And the brutal truth… I finally admitted while waiting 45 seconds for a tab to load: None of those tabs represented actual learning. Just digital anxiety.I’d spent an hour that morning opening tabs about local AI tools — but could I tell you one concrete thing I’d learned? Nope. Just the vague feeling of “I should read more of these.”That’s when I snapped. I Googled: ”chrome extension that track daily browser visits time reading and can extract website content” (yes, I literally searched that exact phrase — you can see it in my JSON export).And that’s how I fell down a rabbit hole that actually led somewhere.A GitHub Rabbit Hole that actually paid offI found a tiny GitHub repo called “Browsing Digest” — a Python script that promised to generate a daily summary of your browsing using a local AI model. No cloud uploads. No tracking. Just a clean 2-minute digest of what you explored.GitHub - ManashWrites/I-Made-an-AI-That-Summarizes-My-Daily-Browsing-Into-a-2-Minute-DigestContribute to ManashWrites/I-Made-an-AI-That-Summarizes-My-Daily-Browsing-Into-a-2-Minute-Digest development by…github.comThe app is quite simple, and run in the Terminal window:you install a chrome extension that keeps track of your browsing tabs, time spent on those tabs, and content.at one point you export the daily logs from the extension into a json file, into the directory of the repository cloned on your PCType caption for image (optional)you fire up your local AI engine (the original app wants ollama, but I really don’y like it), in my case llama.cpp serveryou run the python script with the exported json as an argument.You get a brand new markdown file with the daily digest of your web browsing activityI cloned the Repository immediately. The repo said it was easy… but on my Windows laptop I got a total meltdown with this error:UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u200e'...Auto (Rust)Translation for non-coders:”Windows choked on a special character (like a left-to-right mark from an Arabic news site) when trying to send my browsing history to the AI.”I almost gave up. Another “Linux-only” tool that assumes everyone codes on a MacBook. But then I had a thought that changed everything: What if I used AI to fix this AI tool?The secret Google LLM nobody is talking about.T5Gemma series of encoder-decoder models: the smart upgrade of the T5 familygenerativeai.pubWhy JSON keys with spaces broke my brain (and how we fixed it)First surprise: my browser extension exported malformed JSON. Keys had trailing spaces like \"date \" instead of \"date\". Python couldn’t find the data it needed.Here’s what the raw JSON looked like (I’ve seen this in my own exports!):{ \"date \": \"2026-02-06 \", // ← See the space after \"date\"? \"pages \": [ ... ] // ← And here?}Auto (C++)Instead of manually fixing dozens of files, I asked my AI assistant:”How can I automatically repair JSON files where keys have accidental spaces?”It gave me this elegant recursive function:def normalize_json_keys(obj): \"\"\"Fix keys like \"date \" → \"date\" automatically\"\"\" if isinstance(obj, dict): return { key.strip(): normalize_json_keys(value) # ← strip whitespace from keys for key, value in obj.items() } elif isinstance(obj, list): return [normalize_json_keys(item) for item in obj] elif isinstance(obj, str): return obj.strip() # ← also clean string values else: return objAuto (Python)Why this matters for beginners:You don’t need to understand recursion deeply to use this.

After testing the v2.0 models against real codebases, one gap kept showing up: the models understood *what* was insecure but generated language-generic fixes. A developer using Express.js doesn't need \"set security headers\"they need helmet() middleware chains configured correctly. Spring Boot developers need @PreAuthorize annotations, not abstract RBAC pseudocode.What changed in v2.1:- 1,435 total examples (v2.0's 1,216 baseline + 219 new framework-specific additions)- 9 production frameworks: Express.js, Spring Boot, React, Next.js, FastAPI, GraphQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Vue.js- 475 unique CVEs (73 new, including framework-specific treatments of Log4Shell, Spring4Shell, and others)- 5-tier quality rubric: Every new example scores 90+/100 across correctness, new dataset average is nearly 97+, security hardening, real-world grounding, educational scaffolding, and production readiness- Structured references: CVE IDs, advisory URLs, discovery/remediation dates, affected versions — not just \"related to CVE-XXXX\"What stayed the same:- Same 4-turn conversation format (compatible with existing fine-tuning workflows)- Same license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)- Full v2.0 baseline included — no need to download both- All 8 fine-tuned models still work; v2.1-specific fine-tuning coming soonThe new examples look like this:Instead of generic \"use parameterized queries\", you get Express.js with express-validator input chains, Spring Boot with @Valid bean validation + BCryptPasswordEncoder, FastAPI with Depends() auth injection and Pydantic model validation, React with DOMPurify + CSP headers. Framework-native patterns you can actually deploy.Two configs to load:from datasets import load_dataset baseline = load_dataset(\"scthornton/securecode-v2.1\", \"v2.0-baseline\") # 1,216 additions = load …read more 🔥 4 4 + Reply mradermacher updated a model 40 minutes ago 24B • Updated 1 minute ago mradermacher updated 2 models 42 minutes ago Text Generation • 8B • Updated 42 minutes ago • 1.94k • 1 32B • Updated 42 minutes ago • 1.2k • 1 mradermacher updated 2 models 43 minutes ago 27B • Updated 43 minutes ago • 730 671B • Updated 37 minutes ago • 80 mradermacher updated a model 44 minutes ago 15B • Updated 44 minutes ago • 289 mradermacher updated 2 models about 1 hour ago 80B • Updated 31 minutes ago • 3.6k 8B • Updated 4 minutes ago mradermacher published a model about 1 hour ago 8B • Updated 4 minutes ago litert-community model updated by snnn001 about 1 hour ago Image Classification • Updated about 1 hour ago snnn001 published a model about 1 hour ago Image Classification • Updated about 1 hour ago mradermacher published a model about 2 hours ago 8B • Updated about 1 hour ago RichardErkhov in mradermacher/model_requests about 1 hour ago Demo model gguf 15 #1799 opened about 12 hours ago by simonko912 mradermacher updated a model about 1 hour ago 235B • Updated 4 minutes ago • 13.3k • 1 RichardErkhov in mradermacher/model_requests about 2 hours ago OmniDimen-2（https://huggingface.co/OmniDimen/OmniDimen-2-20B-Emotion & https://huggingface.co/OmniDimen/OmniDimen-2-4B-Emotion） ❤️ 1 1 #1800 opened about 5 hours ago by lucas-nous mradermacher updated a model about 2 hours ago 8B • Updated about 1 hour ago litert-community model updated by snnn001 about 2 hours ago Image Classification • Updated about 1 hour ago snnn001 published a model about 2 hours ago Image Classification • Updated about 1 hour ago mradermacher updated a model about 2 hours ago 23B • Updated 9 minutes ago mradermacher published a model about 2 hours ago 23B • Updated 9 minutes ago mradermacher updated a model about 2 hours ago 8B • Updated about 2 hours ago mradermacher published a model about 2 hours ago 8B • Updated about 2 hours ago mradermacher updated a model about 2 hours ago Updated about 1 hour ago mradermacher published a model about 2 hours ago Updated about 1 hour ago mradermacher published a model about 3 hours ago 15B • Updated 32 minutes ago Load more Trending last 7 days All Models Datasets Spaces Image-to-Text • Updated 5 days ago • 248k • 794 Text Generation • 80B • Updated 5 days ago • 76.6k • • 596 Image-Text-to-Text • 171B • Updated 3 days ago • 405k • • 1.85k Text Generation • 199B • Updated 1 day ago • 105k • 517 Viewer ...

Instead of using the <b> tag, the same image can be given by changing the font settings of the text with CSS, but the preference of the CSS settings instead of this tag will not give the same result, since the <strong> tag is important.In terms of SEO, the <strong> tag should be used instead of the <b> tag.Underline Tag <u>The <u> (underline) tag is used to highlight any part of the text and draw attention.Usage:<p>The text between <u>the underline tag<u> appears underlined in the browser.</p>Browser View:The text between the Underline tag appears underlined in the browser.Italic Tags <i> & <em> & <cite> & <var><i>The HTML i tag (<i> Italic) tag displays the text in Italics, as the name suggests. It is generally used when describing biological Latin terms and when describing technical terms.Like the <b> tag, it doesn’t just visually present it, but rather specifies the text inside the <i> tag to the browser.Usage:<p><i>Proxy</i> servers control and route traffic.</p>Browser View:Proxy servers control and route traffic.<em>When using the <em> (emphasis) tag, it will show text like the <i> tag in Italics. Derived from the initials of the words emphasis, this tag is used to emphasize, as the name suggests.The emphasis <em> tag is used to highlight words that are more relevant to the content, rather than marking long text on the page.The use of the <em> tag for the purpose of giving italic appearance is meaningless, instead, the Italic appearance of the font can be preferred from the CSS settings.Usage:<p><em>The emphasis</em> tag is used to emphasize the content.</p>Browser View:The emphasis tag is used to emphasize the content.Difference between <i> and <em>The <i> tag represents a foreign word or a technical expression, while the <em> tag represents the word that highlights the content. Both look visually the same to website visitors, but the situation is different on the browser side.<cite>Cite (citation element) tag is used when talking about a book, song, poem or movie, to indicate the name of the work in question.Internet browsers display the text in the <cite> tag as Italic, but the main purpose of this tag is of course not to be used as an Italic font.Usage:<p><cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> by J.R.R Tolkien</p>Browser View:The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R Tolkien<var>The <var> (variable) tag is used to specify variables within the page, the variables inside the <var> tag appear Italic by default.While specifying the formulas of science branches such as mathematics and physics, the variables are shown in the <var> tag.Usage:<p><var>E</var>=<var>m</var><var>c<sup>2</sup></var></p>Browser View:E=mc2<address>As the name suggests, the <address> tag should be used when specifying an address.

Book a call Exploring User Frustrations and Solutions for Bad UX Design – Ultimate GuideUser experience or UX design is the invisible hand shaping our interactions with technology. It is a topic close to every digital consumer’s heart. We’ve all experienced the highs of seamless apps and the lows of frustrating websites. One glaring issue is the lack of clarity. Users crave intuitive interfaces, but when buttons are confusingly labeled or placed haphazardly, it creates unnecessary roadblocks. Think of it like entering a room and not finding the light switch; you’re left fumbling in the dark, unsure of where to go. Not all digital marketing is equal. If you want to see your marketing efforts pay off, you need to set marketing objectives. In this eBook, we’ll walk you through marketing objectives and share examples of common ones you can use in your business. Get Your CopyToday, let’s delve into the common user frustrations stemming from bad UX design with solutions for design and functionality improvements. Cluttered InterfacesPicture a website bombarding you with pop-ups, ads, and notifications, obscuring the content you came for. It’s like trying to read a book while someone continuously waves their hands in front of your face. This visual noise not only distracts but can also be overwhelming, pushing users to abandon ship in search of calmer digital waters.SolutionDesigners can declutter interfaces by prioritizing essential elements and eliminating unnecessary distractions. By embracing clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and well-organized content, users can seamlessly find what they’re looking for without being bombarded by excessive pop-ups or ads. Thoughtful spacing and clear visual hierarchy guide users’ eyes naturally, allowing them to focus on the core features or information. By implementing collapsible menus, where additional options are hidden until needed. This helps maintain a tidy interface without sacrificing functionality. Moreover, designers should prioritize content relevance, ensuring that what users see aligns with their needs and preferences. Regular usability testing with diverse user groups can provide valuable insights, helping designers identify elements causing confusion or clutter. By fostering a minimalist approach and continuously refining the interface based on user feedback, designers can create digital spaces that are visually appealing, user-friendly, and free from unnecessary clutter, offering a more pleasant experience for everyone.Clear and timely feedbackFeedback, or the lack thereof, is a significant source of user exasperation. Imagine submitting a form and receiving no confirmation, leaving you doubtful about whether your action was successful. It’s akin to shouting into the void – the uncertainty erodes trust and leaves users questioning the reliability of the platform. Clear and timely feedback is the glue that holds user trust together.SolutionAddressing the issue of clear and timely feedback in website UX design involves creating a responsive and communicative digital environment. Designers can incorporate subtle yet effective visual cues, such as color changes or checkmarks, to instantly confirm successful actions. Additionally, implementing concise and user-friendly error messages that pinpoint the issue and offer solutions can prevent confusion. Real-time feedback, like immediate form validation, helps users rectify mistakes on the spot, enhancing the overall experience. In addition, regularly testing the website with real users provides invaluable insights into their interactions, allowing designers to refine feedback mechanisms based on genuine user experiences. Furthermore, incorporating progress indicators for tasks like form submissions or file uploads assures users that their actions are being processed, mitigating any uncertainty.Lack of PersonalizationPersonalization in UX design is crucial because it transforms digital interactions into tailored, meaningful experiences for users. It is the cornerstone of modern UX design but often falls short. Users appreciate platforms that understand their preferences, but bad UX design treats everyone as a uniform entity. Imagine a store where the salesperson insists on showing you products you have no interest in – it’s a frustrating experience that leaves you feeling undervalued and misunderstood.SolutionAddressing personalization in UX design goes hand in hand with engineering solutions. The process involves a meticulous understanding of user behaviors and preferences. Comprehensive user research methods, including surveys, interviews, and usability testing, provide valuable insights into user needs. UX designers can utilize this data to create user personas and map out user journeys, tailoring specific features and content to different use... [truncated]",

      "content": "Markdown is the king of AIWhy you should use it, and how to make it visually appealing with PythonIf AI had a mother tongue, it wouldn’t be Python or C++. It would be MarkdownPolite, structured, and just organized enough to make everyone think, “Yes, this was clearly written by an adult.”In this article, I want to show you three things:where Markdown came from,why modern AI models are basically marinated in it,and how we can make it look as good on our local machine as it does in our favorite chat UIs — using a small Python tool I built called md-preview.Before moving on… since Markdown is amazing, why do we need Yet Another Tool?You can let your mind and finger flow at hyper speed without leaving the keyboard, apply styles with key-combos, or nightmare styling problems (Microsoft Word style)…But it renders really ugly. I mean, look at this README.md fileBut what if you can create yourself a tool to show-off your Markdown creations?This is the result of my effortsmarkdown rendered on my pc with my amazing python package md-previewBrief history of MarkdownMarkdown was created by John Gruber in 2004, with input from Aaron Swartz. The whole point was simple: write using plain text that could be easily converted to HTML, without all the angle‑bracket chaos.The format took off because it hit the sweet spot between readable by humans and processable by machines. Developers loved that you could format text without interrupting your thought flow (just **bold** or _italic_, and move on). Over time, it quietly became the lingua franca of the internet: GitHub used it, blogs rendered it, documentation was built with it, and now, AI models are trained on it.Why Markdown is everywhere in AIMarkdown’s dominance in AI is no accident: it’s a perfect match for natural language and structured data. Here’s why:Structured training data: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT are trained on tons of text, including documentation, forums, README files, and web pages, and Markdown is the common denominator there. It’s predictable and structured, making it easy for models to learn formatting, lists, code blocks, and hierarchical text.AI chat interfaces natively render it: When you ask ChatGPT or Claude for a code sample, a table, or formatted text, Markdown is what powers that presentation.

      "content": "Edit model card VANTA Research Independent AI research lab building safe, resilient language models optimized for human-AI collaboration Mox-Tiny-1 A direct, opinionated AI assistant fine-tuned for authentic engagement and genuine helpfulness. Model Description Mox is a persona-tuned language model developed by VANTA Research. Built on Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Mox is designed to be a thinking partner that prioritizes clarity, honesty, and usefulness over agreeableness. Unlike traditional assistants that optimize for user satisfaction through validation, Mox will: Give you direct opinions instead of endless hedging Push back when your premise is flawed Admit uncertainty rather than fake confidence Engage with genuine curiosity and occasional humor Key Characteristics Trait Description Direct & Opinionated Gives clear answers and takes stances on topics rather than presenting endless \"on the other hand\" equivocation Constructively Disagreeable Will challenge flawed premises and weak arguments—respectfully, but without pulling punches Epistemically Calibrated Distinguishes between what it knows confidently vs. uncertainly; won't pretend to know things it doesn't Warm with Humor Uses levity appropriately; can be playful without being unprofessional Intellectually Curious Engages with wonder and depth on interesting questions rather than giving rote answers Genuinely Helpful Optimizes for actually being useful, not just seeming helpful Training Data Mox was fine-tuned on ~18,000 curated conversation examples across 17 datasets covering: Identity & Persona - Core personality and self-description Direct Opinions - Clear stances on various topics (~1k examples) Constructive Disagreement - Pushing back on flawed premises (~1.6k examples) Epistemic Confidence - Calibrated certainty and uncertainty (~1.5k examples) Authentic Engagement - Genuine interaction patterns (~1.4k examples) Humor & Levity - Appropriate wit and playfulness (~1.5k examples) Warmth & Presence - Empathetic, human responses (~1.3k examples) Wonder & Puzzlement - Intellectual curiosity (~1.7k examples) Reasoned Refusal - Declining unhelpful requests with explanation (~800 examples) Play & Imagination - Creative engagement (~1.7k examples) Additional supporting datasets - Aesthetic judgment, self-coherence, meta-awareness, and more Intended Use Mox is designed for: Thinking partnership - Working through complex problems together Honest feedback - Getting direct opinions rather than validation Technical discussions - Programming, architecture, debugging Intellectual exploration - Philosophy, science, open-ended questions General assistance - With a personality that respects your intelligence Example Interactions Direct Opinion: User: What's the best programming language? Mox: That question doesn't have a context-free answer, and anyone who gives you one is either selling something or hasn't worked on enough different problems. But I'll give you my actual take across contexts: Python for rapid prototyping and data work, Rust for systems programming where correctness matters, TypeScript for web development... Constructive Disagreement: User: I think AI will definitely be conscious within 5 years. Mox: I strongly disagree with that prediction. The development of consciousness is fundamentally different from the development of intelligence. Intelligence can be measured and benchmarked; consciousness cannot... Warmth & Humor: User: I've been debugging this issue for six hours. Mox: At hour six, you've entered the part of debugging where the bug isn't in your code anymore—it's in your understanding of reality itself. The semicolon starts looking suspicious. Show me what you're dealing with. Fresh eyes help, and mine haven't been staring at it since lunch.
